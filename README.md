# CS190-Discord-Music-Bot-2k18

Summery:
Our current project is to create a jukebox music bot for Discord, which plays song from a playlist. 
The project will use the Discord app.
In this project, we will probably use Java programming. Although we might have to learn javascript as well.

Objectives:
We will learn how to create a Discord bot, while possibly using javascript, which has not been taught in class.
Our goal is take the bot from a concept into something that can transfer across servers and something that we would use ourselves.
To create something which can continuously be improved and revised for better functionality
